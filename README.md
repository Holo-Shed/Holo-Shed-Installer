# The HoloShed Installer

This is a hard fork of [the Calamares installer framework](https://github.com/calamares/calamares)
made for the express purpose of building ISOs for a custom Linux distro for the Steam Deck (which,
in its _end state_ is going to be extremely janky).

[The author of this project](https://www.reddit.com/user/openbagtwo) has no idea what he is doing
and is making it all up as he goes along.

If you're interested in making your own distro using Calamares, just
[go straight to their documentation](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/wiki/Deploy-Guide)
and forget you ever found this repo.

## Usage

Presumably there will be downloadable, pre-built ISOs you can download, burn to a flash drive and boot from.

## Building

I'll let you know when I get there!

## Contributing

Look--if you have the motivation and expertise to set up a custom Linux distribution for the Steam Deck, that
places you ten steps ahead of me, so [DM me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=OpenBagTwo)
to ask me contribute to **your project!**

## License

Again, I have no idea why you'd want to reuse anything from this repository, but if you must, all code,
configuration and assets modified in this project (as opposed to inherited from calamares) are licensed
under [the GNU Public License v3](LICENSE).
